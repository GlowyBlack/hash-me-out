October 24
People: Janaki, Al-Ameen, Laura, Natalie

Summary:
Laura shared the draft PDF of her Kanban board. Our goal for the next meeting is to finalize the
board in person on Sunday from 12:00â€“2:30 PM.
Al-Ameen has been working on restructuring the code by incorporating schemas to better align with 
our class structure. The concept of schemas is new to the team so each member has been assigned to
research schemas and any other unfamiliar topics to ensure a productive discussion during our next
meeting.
We also decided to design the front-end alongside the back-end, rather than completing the back-end
first. Hopefully this approach will make development smoother.

Next Steps:
- Complete the Kanban board on Sunday.
- Continue researching schemas and related concepts.
- Begin drawing and planning the front-end interface.
