Nov 10
People: Janaki, Al-Ameen, Laura, Natalie

Last week was busy for all of us because of midterms, so we postponed our meetings. 
Our next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, November 12. Until then, we will focus on 
completing our backend. Laura is fixing her tests for ratings and finishing the review classes. 
Janaki is working on fixing the user token for the user class so that each user has their own 
session when using the site. Her current tests haven’t been passing, but we’ve been supporting 
her through our reviews on her PR. Natalie is working on the book class and plans to finish the 
code and start testing by Wednesday. Al has been an incredible support throughout this project. 
Last week, he put in a lot of work on the Reading List feature by ironing out issues. Along the 
way, he learned new techniques and insights that he was able to share with the team during our meeting. 
This helped us all better understand the implementation and avoid potential pitfalls when it was time 
to complete our own code. Our next and most challenging focus will be the admin. Since our admin 
extends the user, once we figure out the core functionality of the user, we can use that to guide 
the admin. We also need to implement the Observer Design Pattern. Again, these tasks will be addressed 
after we finalize the core functionality.
