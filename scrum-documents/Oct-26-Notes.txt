People: Janaki, Al-Ameen, Laura, Natalie

We looked into the databases available to us and realized the book ratings actually 
range from 0–10, so we need to update that condition from what we had before.
We created a Kanban board to clearly define what we need to do to meet the project 
requirements and what the TA’s are expecting. We also reviewed our planned transactions. 
These transactions include public/private lists, book requesting, deleting books/users, 
and renaming lists. We designed our sprints, and Janaki added a few more actions to the backlog. 
Al and Natalie started on the frontend. Even though M3 focuses on backend, we want to try 
connecting the frontend and backend earlier so it’s easier later on. Natalie and Al set 
up Next.js, and as a team we sketched a prototype for the frontend on a whiteboard. 
Natalie finalized the drawings on her iPad to show what each view would look like for different users.
