People: Janaki, Al-Ameen, Laura, Natalie

In todayâ€™s meeting, we reviewed our UML diagram for our M2 project again and identified areas
for improvement before the final submission. We spoke about potential methods we should add and
how they can be implemented to improve our class. Laura fixed an issue with her Docker and it is
now running. Finally, we increased the character limit in our code from 70 to 100 to improve
readability.
