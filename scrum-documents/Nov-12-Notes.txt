People: Janaki, Al-Ameen, Laura, Natalie

On this day, we met to discuss our progress so far with testing. 
Al completed the run-backend.yml workflow so that every time we submit a PR, 
the system automatically runs our integration and unit tests. He has made a lot 
of progress on the Reading List, including adding the create_list functionality and 
the associated tests. His next steps include implementing delete_list, rename_list, 
add_books, toggle_visibility, and any other features related to the Reading List, along 
with the associated tests for each. Natalie finished the code for the Book class and its 
unit tests, and she is now working on integration tests. Laura completed her Rating unit 
and integration tests, and she is also working on login, profile display, book page display, 
reading lists display on profiles, filtering books, requesting books, admin views for requests, 
and low-priority admin functionality like suspending users. Janaki finished a portion of user 
authentication, which includes writing login details to Users.csv, storing hashed passwords, 
and adding login and registration endpoints. Her PR has been reviewed, and she is now working 
on the suggested edits. For M3, the team plans to have each class implemented, tested, and have 
basic page displays for books, profiles, and reading lists, along with search functionality.
