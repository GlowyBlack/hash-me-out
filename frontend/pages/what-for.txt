Page Routers
    Pros
    - Stable, widely used, and fully documented.
    - Lots of tutorials & StackOverflow answers (easier for debugging).
    - Simple mental model: each file in /pages is a route.
    - Less “magic” → good for beginners.

    Cons
    - Considered “legacy” now — new Next.js features are moving toward App Router.
    - Less flexible for layouts and server-side rendering patterns.
