App Routers
    Pros
    - The future of Next.js — all new features will be App Router first.
    - Better nested layouts (perfect for role-based dashboards: guest, user, admin).
    - Server Components → reduces frontend bundle size and improves performance.
    - Easier data fetching (no need for getServerSideProps/getStaticProps).

    Cons
    - Newer → less community content (some tutorials still use Pages Router).
    - Slightly steeper learning curve.
    - Some ecosystem packages/docs are still catching up.
