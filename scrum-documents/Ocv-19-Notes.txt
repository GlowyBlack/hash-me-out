People: Janaki, Al-Ameen, Laura, Natalie

In today’s meeting, we worked together on M2 from 1:30–5:30 pm. Laura completed the sequence diagrams,
Natalie completed the component diagram, Janaki completed the architecture diagram and traceability table,
and Al-Ameen completed the DFD Level 1 diagram. Everyone then provided input on the remaining parts.

We decided to remove the profile feature since it isn’t essential to the book review system and doesn’t 
add validity to the project’s core purpose. The provided database only includes basic user details like 
age and location, and while we considered adding a username field, we realized creating an entire profile 
section wasn’t necessary. We also added restrictions on email and password, ensuring that two users can’t 
share the same username. Reviews cannot be empty, and if a review exceeds 500 characters, the user will 
be alerted before submitting. We also removed the update review function since it’s unnecessary.
